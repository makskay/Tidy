== Tidy

Tidy is a simple but powerful issue management system built for scalability and designed for getting things done. Players can create issue reports outlining a problem they're facing, be it a griefer attack or a bug in one of your server's plugins, for server staff to peruse and resolve at leisure.

== Why Tidy?
Not convinced that Tidy is special? Take a look at the wide variety of time-saving features you won't find anywhere else.

=== Tidy is intuitive
> Upon joining a new server, the number of rules and commands that you have to learn can be overwhelming. It's also difficult for most players to remember complicated command sequences. Tidy is designed with both of these problems in mind.

> Since many new players won't realize that they can report a problem, Tidy monitors chat and reminds players who may be panicking that they can file an issue report. Tidy's main command (/helpme) is also easy to remember, increasing the odds that players will remember how to report problems on their own. In fact, /helpme is the only Tidy command that most of your players will ever need to know.

=== Tidy maintains detailed per-issue history
> An issue's creator, as well as server staff, can add comments to an issue in order to clarify details about the problem or discuss how it should best be handled. When the issue is resolved, reopened or stickied, the issue history will record who's responsible and the reason for the change.

> Did I mention sticky issues? If you want to hang onto a particular resolved issue and all the associated discussion and history, just mark it as sticky. Automatic resolved-issue purges will skip right over stickies, so you can get issues out of your open queue without worrying about losing them should they go too long without an update.

=== Tidy automatically reminds you when there's work to do
> Server staff are given a brief digest of currently-open issues when they first log in to the server. The placement of a new issue immediately triggers a notification to all currently-online staff. Staff will even be periodically reminded of any unresolved issues while online.

=== Tidy is self-sufficient
> As an administrator, you're a busy person, and you want to save time wherever you can. I know this for a fact, because I've been there.

> That's why Tidy's default configuration settings are tuned so well that you'll probably never have to edit the config file (though, of course, you can if you want). By default, Tidy will even keep itself up to date by automatically downloading and installing new stable releases from BukkitDev, all without any extra work on your part.

=== Tidy is under active development
> I'm an administrator for a medium-sized public server, and Tidy has become an essential part of my workflow; the fact that I and my fellow staff use it every day pretty much guarantees that bugs will be fixed quickly and new features will be added whenever necessary.

> In fact, there's a number of new features in the works right now:
* Notification on login when there's unread changes to an issue you filed. Coming in Tidy v1.1.
* Issue tags. Put issues into categories (automatically or manually) and search a long list of issues more easily. Assign different tags to different permissions nodes and allow for multiple tiers of support staff - your moderators won't be bothered by issues that only admins can resolve. Planned for Tidy v1.1.
* Support for MySQL and SQLite databases for issue storage. Planned for Tidy v1.2.
* Assignment of issues to specific staff members. Delegate tasks to your staff manually, or auto-assign issues to the currently-online moderator with the least on his plate. Planned for Tidy v1.2.
* If you've got a feature to suggest, head over to the [[https://github.com/makskay/Tidy/issues|Tidy issue tracker]] on GitHub. I'd love to hear from you!
