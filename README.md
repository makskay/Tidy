## Pull Requests
Pull requests are welcomed, but will only be accepted if they conform to [Oracle's Java code conventions](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconv-138413.html). "Self-documenting" and appropriately-commented code that makes clear the role of every method and variable is also appreciated.
